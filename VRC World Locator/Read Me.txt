Run the "Start.bat" file to run "VRC_Locator.PS1". If "VRC_Locator.PS1" opens and then immediately closes, it might mean that the Set-ExecutionPolicy is set to undefined. You will need Set-ExecutionPolicy set to RemoteSigned for localmachine. The easiest solution is to run "Start with Admin.bat" which will allow you to set the ExecutionPolicy to RemoteSigned.

The file "OBSbrowserSource.html" is for a obs browser source. If you open it in your web browser it will not be immediately apparent on a white background. That's because the color of the text is white. White text on a white background will not be seen until you highlight the text. Even then it will most likely only say "Loading..." Reason is this is script is intended to only run in a OBS Browser source. Once added a source in OBS it will automatically update in obs. Feel free to change the color of the text in the HTML file by changing the color on line 9. (ie: color: white). As is, it is intended to run on a black background color source.
